                When you feel down, it’s amazing what a walk in the park can do. That’s because when we get in touch 
                with nature, we improve our wellbeing. Studies show time spent outside in green spaces can reduce our 
                mental fatigue, increase our relaxation, and even improve our cognition.
                However, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we spend a considerable amount of our 
                time indoors instead—around 90%. That is where indoor plants can come to the rescue. Although they are 
                not a substitute for the ‘great outdoors’, indoor plants can provide similar benefits. Studies have shown 
                even brief exposure to nature, like touching real foliage, can elicit an unconscious calming effect. 
                And not only can the presence of indoor plants soothe and restore—but scientific field studies have shown 
                that in workspaces where indoor plants have been added, work performance increased, staff wellbeing improved, 
                and sick-leave absences were reduced. Talk about plants with benefits!
